LTV stands for "lifetime value," and it's a very important concept for e-commerce businesses. One common report that e-commerce CEOs want to see are cohorted views of LTV curves.



ðŸ§  Technically, these curves are "average cumulative revenue" or "average cumulative gross profit" curves since "lifetime value" is a theoretical quantity as time goes to infinity. Nevertheless, pretty much everyone refers to these as "LTV curves" so that's the terminology we'll use here.
Making these curves is notoriously tricky, and it's a thing that is very easy for analysts to get wrong. So, we want to build a helper table in our data warehouse so that analysts and BI tools can easily create these curves correctly.



Goal:
We want to create a table of pre-calculated cumulative revenue values for all of our customers so that we can easily build these cohorted LTV curves.

Exercise: 
Create a table (via dbt) that has one row per customer per week since that user was acquired. The table should have the following columns:
customer_id
week (this should start at 1 for each customer and then increment forward)
revenue (the revenue from that customer in that week should be a lot of zeros)
cumulative_revenue (the cumulative revenue from that customer as of that week)
Again, if you hit a roadblock, ask your teachers and fellow students for help in your cohort Slack group or #self-study! Once you're done, share your work with everyone in those channels! :)

Bonus: 
What tests should we add here? (Think: which columns should be unique? Which columns should always be > 0?)

Bonus:
Calculate average LTV curves by device type
Calculate average LTV curves by quarter of customer acquisition
Note: this is harder than it might seem at first since you need to make sure you have the denominator correct in each week. Good luck!
